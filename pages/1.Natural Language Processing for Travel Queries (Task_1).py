# Model training information for Task 1
st.markdown("""
### Task Overview
In this task, the chatbot focuses on understanding travel-related terminologies and extracting intents, services, locations, and dates from user queries.

### Model Training Information
This chatbot uses a machine learning model trained on travel-related intents and entities. It has been trained using a diverse dataset to accurately interpret user queries and provide relevant information.

The model is designed to:
- **Identify user intents** such as booking flights, checking status, or getting travel advisories.
- **Extract relevant entities** like locations and dates from user queries.

### Current Capabilities
1. **Intent Recognition**: Understand what the user wants to do (e.g., book a flight).
2. **Entity Extraction**: Identify important details from the userâ€™s input, such as destination and travel dates.
3. **Response Generation**: Provide coherent responses based on the user's input and the recognized intents and entities.
